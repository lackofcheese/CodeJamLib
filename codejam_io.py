    The arguments are two functions; - the first (pfun) takes
    four arguments - the input file, the output file, the current case
    number, and any other case data (this is often None).

    The second only requires the input file, and should parse the file for
    the number of cases and any additional data that is needed; this
    data is passed onto pfun via its fourth argument.

    The command-line options are simple - a single input file is expected,
    defaulting to test.in if no file is given. By default, the output
    simply goes to stdout, but this is modified by two options:
        -d    Outputs to a file, which is named by replacing ".in" with ".out"
                on the end of the input filename, or by simply appending
                ".out" afterwards.
